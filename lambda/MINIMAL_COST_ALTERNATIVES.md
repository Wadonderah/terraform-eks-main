| **TOTAL** | **$140/month** | **$11/month** | **92%** | **Core functionality** |

## 🔧 Feature Details

### 1. ❌ X-Ray Tracing → ✅ Minimal X-Ray ($0.05/month)

**Original**: Full tracing of all requests ($0.50 per 1M traces)
**Alternative**: Error-only tracing with PassThrough mode

```hcl
# Minimal X-Ray Configuration
tracing_config {
  mode = "PassThrough" # Only trace when upstream sends trace
}

environment {
  variables = {
    XRAY_TRACE_ERRORS_ONLY = "true"
    LOG_LEVEL = "error"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Still captures critical errors
- 90% cost reduction
- Maintains debugging capability for failures

### 2. ❌ VPC Deployment → ✅ Security Groups ($0/month)

**Original**: VPC with NAT Gateway ($45/month for NAT Gateway)
**Alternative**: Security groups without VPC

```hcl
# Minimal Security Configuration
resource "aws_security_group" "lambda_minimal_sg" {
  name_prefix = "lambda-minimal"
  
  # Only allow HTTPS outbound
  egress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTPS for AWS APIs"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 100% cost savings (no NAT Gateway)
- Still provides network security
- Lambda can access AWS services

### 3. ❌ Provisioned Concurrency → ✅ Lambda Warming ($2/month)

**Original**: 24/7 provisioned concurrency ($15/month)
**Alternative**: Scheduled warming during business hours

```hcl
# Business Hours Lambda Warming
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "lambda_warmer" {
  schedule_expression = "rate(5 minutes)" # Business hours only
  
  # Can be enhanced with time-based conditions
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 87% cost reduction
- Maintains performance during peak hours
- Automatic scaling for unexpected load

### 4. ❌ Aurora MySQL → ✅ DynamoDB Relational ($5/month)

**Original**: Aurora MySQL cluster ($50/month minimum)
**Alternative**: DynamoDB with relational patterns

```hcl
# DynamoDB as Relational Alternative
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "invoice_relational" {
  name         = "invoice-relational"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "invoice_id"
  range_key    = "entity_type"
  
  # No provisioned capacity = pay only for usage
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 90% cost reduction
- Serverless scaling
- Still supports complex queries with GSI

### 5. ❌ Enhanced Monitoring → ✅ Basic Monitoring ($1/month)

**Original**: Comprehensive monitoring with detailed metrics ($10/month)
**Alternative**: Critical error alerts only

```hcl
# Critical Errors Only
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "minimal_error_alarm" {
  threshold           = "10" # Only alert on 10+ errors
  alarm_description   = "Critical Lambda errors only"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 90% cost reduction
- Still catches critical issues
- Focuses on actionable alerts

### 6. ❌ Cross-Region Replication → ✅ Weekly Backup ($3/month)

**Original**: Real-time cross-region replication ($20/month)
**Alternative**: Weekly backup to cheaper region/storage

```hcl
# Weekly Backup to Glacier
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "weekly_backup" {
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 2 ? * SUN *)" # Sunday 2 AM
}

# Immediate Glacier storage
StorageClass: 'GLACIER'
```

**Benefits**:
- 85% cost reduction
- Still provides disaster recovery
- Weekly frequency sufficient for most use cases

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy All Minimal Features
```bash
./deploy-minimal-features.sh
```

### Option 2: Selective Deployment
```hcl
# In terraform.tfvars
deploy_minimal_features = false
enable_minimal_xray = true
enable_minimal_vpc = true
enable_lambda_warming = false  # Disable if not needed
enable_minimal_database = true
enable_minimal_monitoring = true
enable_minimal_backup = false  # Disable if not needed
```

### Option 3: Terraform Variables
```bash
terraform apply \
  -var="deploy_minimal_features=true" \
  -var="monthly_budget_limit=25"
```

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

### When Usage Grows
If monthly costs exceed $25, consider upgrading:

1. **$25-50/month**: Enable more features
   ```hcl
   cost_optimization_level = "moderate"
   lambda_memory_cost_optimized = 192
   log_retention_days_cost_optimized = 5
   ```

2. **$50-100/month**: Add provisioned capacity
   ```hcl
   dynamodb_billing_mode = "PROVISIONED"
   enable_lambda_warming = false  # Use provisioned concurrency instead
   ```

3. **$100+/month**: Consider full features
   ```hcl
   enable_xray_tracing = true
   enable_enhanced_monitoring = true
   enable_vpc = true  # With proper cost management
   ```

## 🔍 Monitoring Minimal Features

### Cost Tracking
```bash
# Check current month costs
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2024-01-01,End=2024-01-31 \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost \
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check Lambda performance
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/textract-processor \
  --filter-pattern "REPORT" \
  --start-time $(date -d "1 hour ago" +%s)000
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Lambda Cold Starts**
   - Solution: Adjust warming schedule
   - Cost: Minimal increase ($0.50/month)

2. **DynamoDB Throttling**
   - Solution: Enable auto-scaling
   - Cost: Pay-per-request handles this automatically

3. **Missing Detailed Logs**
   - Solution: Temporarily increase log retention
   - Cost: $0.50 per GB per month

4. **Backup Failures**
   - Solution: Check IAM permissions
   - Cost: No additional cost

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Optimize Lambda for minimal cost
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    // Minimize memory usage
    const processedData = await processMinimal(event);
    
    // Early return to reduce execution time
    if (event.warmer) {
        return { statusCode: 200, body: 'warmed' };
    }
    
    return processedData;
};
```
